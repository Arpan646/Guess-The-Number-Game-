**Guess the Number Game**

**Description:**
This Python script implements a simple "Guess the Number" game where the user tries to guess a randomly chosen number between 1 and 100. The program provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too low or too high, helping the user narrow down the correct answer. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number.

**Instructions:**
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download or clone the `guess_the_number.py` file from this repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where the `guess_the_number.py` file is located.
5. Run the script by executing the command: `python guess_the_number.py`.
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to guess the number.

**Features:**
- Randomly generated secret number between 1 and 100.
- User input for guessing the number.
- Feedback on whether the guess is too low or too high.
- Number of attempts displayed upon guessing the correct number.
- Option to play the game multiple times by rerunning the script.

**Dependencies:**
